# Decentralised fundraising

**IDEA**

To create a decentralized and incentivized fund raising application for the startups, social cause on Ethereum using blockchain technology.

**Problem statement**

Problems with today's fundraising application like KickStarter.com and Ketto.Org.
The contributors and the donators have no knowledge of where their donated money is being used at or for. They have no control of their raised funds once the contribution have been made. According to a research, 9% of the projects on KickStarter fail to deliver the product. The person who started the funding campaign may use the funds for his/her personal needs thereby dissolving the essence of whole fund raising idea.

**Our approach**

It is to implement a decentralized application on Ethereum Network using blockchain technology. Anyone can start a campaign through the application. The contributors can donate the money to the smart contract that we will deploy. Every contributor agrees to the created request and consensus if formed. In this process, the contributors also gets incentive with the token from the smart contract at the time they contribute the funds each time.
